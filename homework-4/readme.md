## Homework 4 recap
___
###### Had a problem with the instruments list, I had originally made the list not have quotations around the list items. So I kept having errors that said Piano was not defined. Then after looking around a bit I saw that I forgot to put "Piano" and I had just Piano in the array.

###### I forgot that I didn't have to use element.id and I could also just use query which was nice, saves some time because you don't have to go in the HTML side and give id's and classes to everything and can just select it with the queryselector.

###### I also figured out, if you want to add image links for example how I had to in gallery, you have to put them in quotations or they mess up the table.
