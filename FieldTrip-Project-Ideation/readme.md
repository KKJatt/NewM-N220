## Field Trip Project

### Project Summary

My project will be over the Elitejorg Museum's Western Art Collection. I chose this topic because I have always liked Western Movies and just learning about history around that era.

### Core Webpages

Some of the core webpage's i'd include would be:

- Home page: Gives a brief introduction to the website and talks about what years this website is based on.
- Gallery page: Shows art works that once you hover over they enlarge and show a quick description about the photo.
- Games page: Let's you play a quick mini game or two. For example, one of the minigame's would be a card memory game.


### Design Choices

One of they websites I might reference is the Elitejorg Museum. I got the hover idea from their website when your mouse is over a photo.
Another website I would reference is the WildWestBootStore.com. The reason for this is I really like the color pallet that they used in their website. Colors like brown, tan, gold, and bronze are some of the colors I would use.
