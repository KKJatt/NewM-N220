## Field Trip Project
##### Karanjot Singh Kailay

### Project Summary

My project will be over the Elitejorg Museum's **Western Art Collection**. I chose this topic because I have always enjoyed Western Movies and just learning about history around that era. I also love playing Red Dead Redemption 2 which inspired me to make some games based on the topic that I chose, in this case Western Art.

### Core Webpages

Some of the core webpage's i'd include would be:

- Home page: Gives a brief introduction to the website and talks about what years this website is based on.
- Gallery page: Shows art works that once you hover over they enlarge and show a quick description about the photo.
- Games page: Let's you play a quick mini game or two. For example, one of the minigames would be a card memory game.


### Design Choices

One of they websites I might reference is the <a href="https://eiteljorg.org/collections/western-art/"> Elitejorg Museum Western Art page </a>. I got the hover idea from their website when your mouse is over a photo they show you a magnifying glass, allowing you to click it to enlarge it.
Another website I would reference is the <a href="https://www.wildwestbootstore.com">Wild West Boot Store</a>. The reason for this is I really like the color pallet that they used in their website. Colors like brown, tan, gold, beige, and bronze are some of the colors I would use.

For the data structure to store the data for the games I will use local storage to store the players highest score for the mini games. So every time they go back they can see what their highest score was. Even if they close the browser and come back they will still be able to see their score. It would get deleted if they cleared the cache. For the gallery I would have a array with each artwork object. It would have the name of the artwork, description, and image source. Similar images with the same structure would be in the home page.
